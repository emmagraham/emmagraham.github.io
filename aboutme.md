I am an MD/PhD student at UW-Madison (entering class of 2019). 

### Education

I completed my Bachelor's of Science at Yale University (class of '16), majoring in Molecular Biochemistry and Biophysics. I then moved to sunny Vancouver, Canada, to pursue a Master's in Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the lab of Dr. Sara Mostafavi.

### Research interests

Broadly, I am interested in developing methods that combine insights from multiple types of “omics” data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and clinical phenotyping, to better understand the interplay between genes, proteins, and metabolites, and how they contribute to disease. 

### Major Projects

During my master’s degree, I developed a method to prioritize genetic mutations causing neurometabolic diseases through the integration of genomic and metabolomic evidence. This approach was developed for use in the Treatable Intellectual Disability - Exome (TIDEX) project, a program that collected clinical phenotype, whole exome sequencing and metabolomic profiling data on patients with undiagnosed neurometabolic disorders at BC Children's Hospital. Since graduating from my Master's degree, I have also used the ROSMAP data to explore whether men undergo mosaic loss of the sex chromosomes chromosome in the blood and brain.
