**1. Load the tidyverse and gapminder packages. Using group\_by(),
filter() and summarize(), create a table that identifies the countries
that had the lowest and highest GDP per capita in each continent across
all years. Using the arrange() function, order the rows alphabetically
by continent and from lowest to highest GDP per capita. Remove all
columns except those describing continent, country, gdpPercap and
year.**

**2. Let's visually see if this makes sense. Using all gapminder data,
create a scatterplot with continent on the x-axis and GDP per capita on
the y-axis. This type of graph is called a stripplot.**

**3. Do the same thing as above but this time using the table you
created in question 1. Map the color of the points to the country
variable.**

**4. Using all gapminder data, create a boxplot of GDP per capita across
all continents (using geom\_boxplot()).**

**5. Using all gapminder data, use the group\_by() and summarize()
functions to find the mean and median GDP per capita per continent.
Print the resulting table.**

**6. Create a density plot (using geom\_density()) of GDP per capita for
each continent. Display GDP per capita in log10 scale by adding (+
scale\_x\_log10()) after calling geom\_density().**

**7. Create a table of mean life expectancies in each continent for each
year.**
